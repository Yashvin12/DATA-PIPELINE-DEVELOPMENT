Data Science Internship Tasks
This repository contains the deliverables for the Data Science Internship at CODTECH, covering all four mandatory tasks. Each task is designed to demonstrate proficiency in data preprocessing, deep learning, end-to-end project development, and optimization techniques using Python.

ðŸ“‹ Task Descriptions
Task 1: Data Preprocessing, Transformation, and Loading Pipeline
In this task, a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is developed using pandas and scikit-learn. The automated pipeline handles data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and loading, ensuring the data is well-structured and ready for analytics or machine learning applications. The deliverable is a Python script or Jupyter Notebook showcasing the complete ETL process.

Task 2: Deep Learning Model for Image Classification or NLP
This task involves implementing a deep learning model using TensorFlow or PyTorch for either image classification or natural language processing (NLP). The project covers data preparation, model architecture design, training, and evaluation. The final deliverable includes a functional model with visualizations of the results, demonstrating the model's performance and insights.

Task 3: End-to-End Data Science Project
A comprehensive data science project is developed from start to finish, involving data collection, preprocessing, model training, and deployment. Using Flask or FastAPI, the project is deployed as an API or a web application to showcase the model's functionality. This task emphasizes building a full data science workflow, including the deployment of a user-accessible model.

Task 4: Solving a Business Problem with Optimization Techniques
In the final task, an optimization problem is solved using techniques like linear programming with Python and libraries such as PuLP. The project demonstrates the complete process, from problem formulation and model setup to solution extraction and insights. The deliverable is a Jupyter Notebook providing a clear and structured approach to solving the business problem.
