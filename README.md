Data Preprocessing, Transformation, and Loading Pipeline
This project presents an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implemented using Python, leveraging powerful data processing libraries like pandas and scikit-learn. The primary goal is to streamline the data preprocessing workflow, ensuring the data is clean, well-structured, and ready for machine learning or analytical tasks.

üìÇ Project Overview
Data preprocessing is a critical step in any data science or analytics project. It involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data to enhance the quality and performance of downstream models. This ETL pipeline automates these steps to reduce manual effort and maintain a consistent, reproducible process.

üîç Key Features
Data Ingestion: The pipeline accepts data from various sources, including CSV files, databases, and APIs. The pandas library is used for seamless data loading and handling.
Data Cleaning: Missing values, duplicate records, and outliers are addressed through robust cleaning techniques, including imputation strategies and data validation.
Data Transformation: The pipeline offers a wide array of data transformation features, such as encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical data, and applying feature engineering techniques using scikit-learn's preprocessing tools.
Data Loading: The processed data is exported to a specified format, whether as a CSV file, a database table, or directly into a machine learning pipeline.

üöÄ Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for building the pipeline.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, providing DataFrame structures and powerful data operations.
Scikit-learn: Utilized for preprocessing techniques such as StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, and SimpleImputer.
Jupyter Notebook: Facilitates the interactive development and visualization of the data processing steps.

üìà Pipeline Steps
Extract: Load raw data using pandas.read_csv() or other relevant functions.
Transform: Apply data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering techniques.
Load: Save the transformed data to the desired format using pandas.to_csv() or direct database integration.

Applications
This ETL pipeline is ideal for:

Preparing datasets for machine learning models.
Automating data transformation workflows.
Maintaining data quality and consistency in analytics projects.
